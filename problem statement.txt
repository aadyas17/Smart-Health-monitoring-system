our project titled:Design and Implementation of a Smart Health Monitoring and Early Warning System for Water-Borne Diseases/Sentinel: An Intelligent Human Health Monitoring and Early Warning System for Water-Borne Diseases

which is:
Smart Community Health Monitoring and Early Warning System for Water-Borne Diseases in Rural areas
Problem Statement

This problem statement proposes the development of a Smart Health Surveillance and Early Warning System that can detect, monitor, and help prevent outbreaks of water-borne diseases in vulnerable communities. The system can be:

• Collect health data from local clinics, ASHA workers, and community volunteers via web page
• Use AI/ML models to detect patterns and predict potential outbreaks based on symptoms, water quality reports, and seasonal trends.
• Integrate with water testing kits or IoT sensors to monitor water source contamination (e.g., turbidity, pH, bacterial presence) - if possible (we have no knowledge about it currently but we are thinking to integrate it)
• Provide real-time alerts to district health officials and local governance bodies.
• Offer dashboards for health departments to visualize hotspots, track interventions, and allocate resources.

Background

Water-borne diseases such as diarrhea, cholera, typhoid, and hepatitis A are prevalent in many rural areas and tribal belts especially during the monsoon season. These outbreaks are often linked to contaminated water sources, poor sanitation infrastructure, and delayed medical response. The terrain and remoteness of many villages make it difficult for health workers to monitor and respond to emerging health threats in time.

Expected Solution

A digital health platform that includes:

• A web application for data collection and community health reporting.
• AI-based outbreak prediction engine using health and environmental data.
• Integration with low-cost water quality sensors or manual test kits.
• Alert system for health authorities and local leaders.
• Educational modules for hygiene awareness and disease prevention.
